            <p>I decided to take CPSC 349 for the following reasons: </p>
            <ol class = "reasons-oltext">
                <li>I want to diversify and learn more languages to see what I like and don't like</li> 
                <li>I want to expand my knowledge in programming.</li>
                <li>Seemed like a fun and free flowing class that I can enjoy</li>
                <li>Always had an interest</li>
            </ol>
            <p>I have never learned HTML however, I have edited HTML code to make my Tumblr and Myspace homepages or something.</p>
            <p>Other than that, this is my first time actually sitting down and trying to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript\!</p>

            <h2>Reasons continued...</h2>
            
            <p>I'm hoping to learn as much as possible to see if this is something I can see myself do in the future.</p>
            <p>Maybe I can make my own website or use this in the future to further my career. Who knows but we'll have to wait and see...</p>
